# Account Dossier Generator (AI for Bharat – Week 2 Challenge)

This project automates the process of understanding large folders of training or business materials by generating concise *dossiers* for each subfolder. Each dossier includes:

- A 2–3 sentence autogenerated context summary  
- Top recently modified files  
- Short summaries per file  
- Inferred status labels (Draft, Final, Needs Attention, Archived, etc.)  
- Keywords extracted from file contents  
- Suggested next actions  
- A global `accounts_index.csv` with metadata for all files

This helps quickly understand past work, training materials, or accumulated documents without manually reading through everything.

## 🚀 What the script does

Using a Google Colab notebook, the script:

1. Scans a root folder (e.g., “Business Training”) in your Google Drive  
2. Reads files like:  
   - PDF  
   - DOCX  
   - PPTX / PPT  
   - XLSX / XLS  
   - TXT / MD / CSV  
3. Extracts text where possible  
4. Generates:  
   - `*_dossier.md` files (one per subfolder)  
   - `accounts_index.csv` (all files flattened into a searchable index)

## 🧠 How Kiro was used

Kiro helped with:
- Designing the overall automation approach  
- Generating code scaffolding  
- Refining the text extraction logic  
- Improving summaries and suggested actions  
- Drafting this README and the AWS blog post  

All Kiro prompts used are documented in `.kiro/prompts.txt`.
